Hit them with a hammer a few times and you will have a beautiful stone slab. After you click on the first fork, you can Sneak + Click on it to toggle the work area highlight.<br><br>Depending on the material of the plug you are using, you can get more stone in one go. For example up to 3x3x3 cube for copper and 7x7x7 for steel.<br><br>The size of the slab you get depends on how much stone you cut at one time. While any type of slab can be used, be aware that larger slabs take up more space when placed.<br><br>Now go get some of this stone after you read <a href=\"handbook://stonequarry-masonguide\">Stone Cutting Guide</a>.",
